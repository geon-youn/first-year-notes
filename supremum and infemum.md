# Supremum and Infemum
Let $A\subseteq\mathbb{R}$. 

$\beta$ is a **supremum** (*least [[bound|upper bound]]*) of $A$ if $\beta$ is an upper bound of $A$ and if $u$ is an upper bound of $A$, then $\beta\leq u$. 

$\alpha$ is a **infemum** (*greatest [[bound|lower bound]]*) of $A$ if $\alpha$ is an lower bound of $A$ and if $l$ is a lower bound of $A$, then $l\leq\alpha$. 

Supremum and infemum of a set are unique.
