# Web Pages
**Web pages** are documents that contain links to other units of information inside and outside the document. They contain text and markup tags. They may contain embedded images and interactive programs. They are usually written using [[HTML]]. 

Information is represented in two ways:
1. Statically in files.
2. Dynamically via scripts or programs that assemble information on the fly. 

The links allow one to travel across the [[World Wide Web]]. 

Software tools are used to develop and present web pages.
