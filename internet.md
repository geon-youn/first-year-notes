# Internets
We want to be able to communicate across different computer networks, possibly based on different network technologies. So, we can build a universal virtual network on top of the [[physical network]]s.

An **internet** is a virtual network based on 
1. The [[internet architecture]]
2. The [[TCP IP Internet Protocol Suite|TCP/IP Internet Protocol Suite]]

The global **Internet** is an internet that serves as a **universal virtual network**.

## History (ARPA)
The U.S. Department of Defense's **Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA)** started funding research in internet technology in the 1970s. This funding led to the creation of the **ARPANET**. ARPANET is the backbone of the global, TCP/IP-based Internet. ARPANET was mainly used to support U.S. military communication and university research.
