# Mathematical Models
**Mathematical models** consist of objects, concepts, and facts.
1. A model is **created** to describe a particular mathematical phenomenon exhibited in the world.
2. The model is **explored** in various ways to discover new objects, concepts, and facts related to the model.
3. The resulting enriched model then provides a deeper understanding of the mathematical phenomenon.
