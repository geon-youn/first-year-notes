# Software Engineering
An area of [[engineering]] that deals with the development of software products that
- are large or complex;
- exist in multiple versions;
- exist for large periods of time;
- are continuously being modified;
- are built by teams.
Software engineering relies heavily on mathematical techniques (especially [[logic]] and discrete mathematics).

## Principles
1. **Rigor**: Reasoning should be precise.
2. **[[separation of concerns|Separation of concerns]]**: Different concerns should be isolated and considered separately. 
3. **[[modularity|Modularity]]**: Complex systems should be divided into smaller parts, called *modules*.
4. **Least Privilege**: Each subject should be given the fewest privileges needed for it to perform its task.
5. **Formality**: Reasoning should be done using a language with a formal syntax and precise semantics.
6. **[[abstraction|Abstraction]]**: What is important should be separated out from what is irrelevant.
7. **[[anticipation of change|Anticipation of change]]**: Future change should be anticipated and planned for.
8. **Generality**: Whenever possible, a more general problem should be solved isntead of the problem at hand.
9. **Incrementality**: A problem should be attacked by producing successively closer approximation to a solution.
