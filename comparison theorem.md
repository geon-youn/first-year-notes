# Comparison theorem
Sometimes you can't find the exact value of an improper integral, but it's important to know whether it's convergent or divergent. Although it's mostly for [[improper integral of type 1|type 1]] integrals, a similar theorem is true for [[improper integral of type 2|type 2]] integrals:

Suppose that $f$ and $g$ are continuous functions with $f(x)\geq g(x)\geq 0$ for $x\geq a$. 

If $\int^\infty_af(x)dx$ is convergent, then $\int^\infty_ag(x)dx$ is convergent.

If $\int^\infty_ag(x)dx$ is divergent, then $\int^\infty_af(x)dx$ is divergent. 

## Alternative Explanation
If the area under $f$ is finite, then so is the area under $g$. 

If the area under $g$ is infinite, then so is the area under $f$.
