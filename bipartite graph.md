# Bipartite graph
A [[graph|simple graph]] $G$ is **bipartite** if $V$ can be partitioned into two disjoint subsets $V_1$ and $V_2$ such that every edge connects a vertex in $V_1$ and a vertex in $V_2$. I.e., there's no edges which connect two vertices in $V_1$ or in $V_2$. 

Alternative explanation:

A graph where you can colour the vertices red or blue such that no two [[adjacent (graph)|adjacent]] vertices are the same colour.
