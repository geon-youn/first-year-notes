# Symmetry
When we sketch [[polar curves]], we can sometimes take advantage of symmetry. There are three rules:

1. If a polar equation is unchanged when $\theta$ is replaced by $-\theta$, the curve is symmetric about the [[polar coordinate system|polar axis]].

2. If the equation is unchanged with $r$ is replaced by $-r$, or when $\theta$ is replaced by $\theta +\pi$, the curve is symmetric about the pole (the curve remains unchanged if we rotate it by 180 degrees).

3. If the equation is unchanged when $\theta$ is replaced by $pi-\theta$, the curve is symmetric about the vertical line $\theta=\pi/2$.
