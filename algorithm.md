# Algorithm
Controls the behaviour of [[computer]]s and are implemented by [[program]]s. 

A finite set of precise instructions for performing a computation or solving a problem.

## Specifying Algorithms
The steps of an algorithm can be described in English or in *[[2C03/pseudocode|pseudocode]]*. 

## Properties
### Input
An algorithm has input values from a specified set.
### Output
From the input values, the algorithm produces the output values from a specified set. The output values are the solution.  
### Correctness
An algorithm should produce the correct output values for each set of input values.
### Finiteness
An algorithm should produce the output after a finite number of steps for any input.
### Effectiveness
It must be possible to perform each step of the algorithm correctly and in finite amount of time.
### Generality
The algorithm should work for all problems of the desired form.
