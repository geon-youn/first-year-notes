# Postulates
Geometric constructions that we agree are possible. The [[axiom]]s are made according to tools for constructing figures: **compass** and **straightedge**.

[P1]: A straight line can be drawn from any one point to another.
[P2]: A line segment can be extended any distance beyond each endpoint.
[P3]: A [[circle]] can be constructed from any given point and radius.
[P4]: All [[right angle]]s are equal to one another.
[P5]: [[Playfair's Axiom]][^1]

[^1]: Another way to say Playfair's Axiom is to say if a line intersects two straight lines, then if there is a side where the two interior angles sum to less than two [[right angle]]s, then if those two straight lines are extended infinitely at that side, those two straight lines will intersect.
