# Information Security
**Information security** is concerned with the protection of electronically stored and manipulated information and the *systems* used to store and manipulate information. It is closely related to the problem of **software reliability**. Information systems and security mechanisms are heavily based on software. Software is difficult to develop and maintain and are very often unreliable. 

Information security is a **unique** field because it deals with **misuse** rather than **proper use**. It is also hard to engineer. It involves most components of an informatoin system. Information security requirements clash with many other system requirements. It cuts across component boundaries and levels of abstraction.  And, it's hard to separate misuse from other concerns. *A system is only as secure as its weakest component*, so it's a constant cycle of fixing the weakest component. 

There are three things that need to be protected:
1. **Data**:
	- [[confidentiality]]
	- [[integrity]]
	- [[availability]]
2. **Information systems**:
	- system confidentiality
	- system integrity
	- availability of services
	- system resources (disk storage, CPU cycles, etc.)
	- monitoring mechanisms
	- security mechanisms
3. Your **personal** and **organization**'s **reputation**.
