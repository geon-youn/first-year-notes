# Combinatorial Proofs
A **combinatorial proof** of an identity is a proof that uses one of the following methods:
- A **double counting proof** uses counting arguments to prove that both sides of an identity count the same objects, but in different ways.
- A **[[bijective]] proof** shows that there is a bijection between the sets of objects counted by the two sides of the identity.
