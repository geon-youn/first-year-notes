# Logic
**Logic** is the study of the principles underlying **sound reasoning** and the branch of mathematics underlying **mathematical reasoning** and **[[computing]]**.

*A* logic is a resoning system with
1. A **language** with a formal syntax and precise semantics;
2. concepts of **truth** and **logical consequence** (`if .. then ..`);
3. a **proof system** for establishing that statements in the language are true.

## Uses of Logic in [[computing|Computing]]
### Theoretical uses
To study computation, programming languages, and software design.
### Practical uses
- To write **precise documentation** about [[software artifacts]] that can be stored and manipulated by computers;
- to **reason** about software artifacts, possibly with the help of mathematical software systems like proof assistants;
- to implement **electronic circuits**;
- to provide **reasoning facilities** in programming languages.
