# [[domain name|Domain Name]] System (DNS)
DNS provides a **hierarchial scheme** for naming hosts and collections of hosts. It maps host names to [[IP address]]es and maps IP addresses to host names. Host names may be assigned **aliases**. It also stores information about hosts and collections of hosts such as the **mail exchange servers** used by the hosts. DNS is managed by a set of cooperating [[name server]]s. 

DNS may be used with any set of [[domain name]]s, but the [[internet|Internet]]'s DNS currently uses a set of official top-level domain names of three kinds:
1. Generic top-level domains (gTLDs).
2. Country code top-level domains (ccTLDs).
3. Infrastructure top-level domain (only `arpa`).

There were originally six gTLDs: `com`, `net`, `org`, `edu`, `gov`, `mil`.
