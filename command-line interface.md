# Command-Line Interfaces (CLIs)
A CLI enables a user to access the operating system or other program via an interacting text-oriented program that runs inside a **terminal window**. For [[operating system]]s, this program is called a **[[shell]]**.
## Advantages
- CLIs use fewer resources and are more powerful than [[graphical user interface|GUIs]].
## Disadvantages
- CLIs are much harder to use than GUIs.
