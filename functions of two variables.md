# Functions of two variables
A **function of two variables** $f$ is a rule that assigns each ordered pair of [[real numbers]] $(x, y)$ in a [[set]] $D$ a unique real number denoted by $f(x, y)$. The set $D$ is the [[domain]] of $f$ and its [[range]] is the set of values $f$ takes on, that is $\left\{f(x,y)\mid(x,y)\in D\right\}$. 

We often write $z=f(x,y)$ to make explicit the value taken on by $f$ at the point $(x, y)$. The variables $x$ and $y$ are the independent variables and $z$ is the dependent variable. 

A function of two variables is just a [[First Year/function]] whose domain is a [[subset]] of $\mathbb{R}^2$ and whose range is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$.

If a function is given by a formula and no specific domain, the domain is the set of all pairs $(x, y)$ for which the expression is a well-defined real number. 

## Graphs
If $f$ is a function of two variables with domain $D$, then the **graph** of $f$ is the set of all points $(x, y, z)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ such that $z=f(x,y)$ and $(x, y)$ is in $D$. 

## Level curves (contour map)
The **level curves** of a function $f$ of two variables are the curves with equations $f(x, y)=k$, where $k$ is a constant (in the range of $f$).
