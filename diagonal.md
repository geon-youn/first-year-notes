# Diagonal Matrix
A special case of [[triangular]] matrices, where both the values above and below the [[main diagonal]] is $0$s such that it is equivalent to an [[identity matrix]] for $\mathbb{R}^n$ multiplied by a [[B-coordinate vector]] with $n$ elements:

$$D=\mathbb{I}_n\vec{c}$$

where $D$ is a diagonal matrix and $\vec{c}$ is the B-coordinate vector for $\mathbb{I}_n$.
