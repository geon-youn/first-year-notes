# Solution Set Existence
Let $A$ be an $m\times n$ matrix. Then, the following statements are [[logically equivalent]]:
1. For each $\vec{b}$ in $\mathbb{R}^m$, the equation $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$ has a solution.
2. Each $\vec{b}$ in $\mathbb{R}^m$ is a [[linear combination]] of the columns of $A$. 
3. The columns of $A$ [[span]] $\mathbb{R}^m$.
4. $A$ has a [[pivot position]] in every row.
