# Partial differential equations
[[partial derivative of f with respect to x at (a, b)|Partial derivatives]] occur in partial [[differential equation]]s that express certain physical laws. For instance the equation below with [[second partial derivative]]s (where $u$ is a [[functions of two variables]] $u(x,y)$):

> $$\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial y^2}=0$$

is **Laplace's equation** (for two dimensions; with each new dimension, you add another $\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x_i^2}$ to the left side), whose solutions are called **harmonic functions** that play a role in problems of heat conduction, fluid flow, and electric potential. 

The **wave equation**

> $$\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial t^2}=a^2\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2}$$

describes the motion of a waveform.
