# Proof by Contradiction
In a **proof by contradiction** we start by assuming what we are given AND that the conclusion of our claim is false. Then, we use these assumptions to reach a new conclusion that is logically impossible. This impossibility rules out the possibility that the conclusion of our claim is FALSE. So, given a condition `if P then Q`, then we assume the condition `if P then not Q`, and eventually show that this new condition is false so `if P then Q` must be true.
