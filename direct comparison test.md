# Direct comparison test
Suppose that $\sum a_n$ and $\sum b_n$ are [[series]] with positive terms. 

If $\sum b_n$ is [[divergence test for series|convergent]] and $a_n\leq b_n$ for all $n$, then $\sum a_n$ is also convergent. 

If $\sum b_n$ is [[divergence test for series|divergent]] and $a_n\geq b_n$ for all $n$, then $\sum a_n$ is also divergent. 

(similar to [[comparison theorem|comparison test]])
