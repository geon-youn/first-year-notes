# Software Development Process
A **rational development process** is needed to produce quality software. Any proposed rational process is necessarily an **idealization** (can't always be implemented perfectly):
- Humans inevitably make errors.
- Communication between humans is imperfect.
- Many things are not understood at the start.
- Supporting technology always has limitations.
- Requirements change over time. 

## Phases
1. **Problem Identification**: What is the problem that needs to be solved?
2. (Most Important) **Requirements Specification (Problem Definition)**: What are the product requirements that need to be satisfied? What objectives, functions, and constraints are relevant?
3. **Design**: How will the problem be solved? How will the product requirements be satisfied?
4. **Implementation**: What is a solution to the problem? What is an executable implementation of the design?
5. **Testing and Verification**: What behaviour does the product exhibit? Is the behaviour correct?
6. **Delivery and Maintenance**: How will the product be delivered and maintained? How will be continue to satisfy requirements? 
## Models
1. **Waterfall**: Development follows the logical order of the phases in a linear fashion. (An idealization of the software development process that is rarely realized; e.g. some requirements are missing, then we have to go back to step 2. from step 3.).
2. **Spiral**: The steps of the waterfall model are repeatedly applied until a suitable product is obtained.
3. **Refinement (Top-Down)**: The product requirements are step-wise refined through a series of designs until an implementation of the product is reached.
4. **Prototyping**: A prototype of the product is developed first and then thrown away. We need to build something to understand the problem.
5. **Incremental**: A partial product is developed and incrementally extended until a full product is obtained.
6. **Agile**: A product evolves through a dialetic between the client and developers. Figure out the requirements by asking the client.
