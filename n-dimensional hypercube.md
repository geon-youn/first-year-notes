# N-dimensional hypercube
An **n-dimensional hypercube** or *n-cube* $Q_n$ is a graph with $2^n$ vertices representing all bit strings of length $n$ where there's an edge between two vertices that differ in exactly one bit position.

Used in distribute computation where vertices are computing nodes and edges are local network connections. Each pair of vertices has the shortest path at most $n$.
