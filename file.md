# Files
A **file** is a finite sequence of data stored on a persistent data storage device. The data is usually [[characters]] or bits. There are many kinds of files, but they can be split into two groups:
1. Text files ([[ASCII]] or [[Unicode]]);
2. Binary files (bits). 

Files allow sharing of data between programs, users, computers, and storage devices. 

The **extension** (suffix) of a file name is used to edentify the file's format. **XML** is a customizable file format that uses begin and end tags like `<address>` and `</address>`. XML files are easy for machines to manipulate, but hard for humans to read.
