# Post-hoc analysis
If [[ANOVA]] states that not all [[centre|population mean]]s are equal, we can investigate further which population means are different by pairwise-comparisons. This process is called **post-hoc analysis** to ANOVA. 

A possible method for post-hoc analysis is the t-test of significance between two population means ($H_A:\mu_1-\mu_2>0$, etc). This method can be performed for all possible pair combinations. 

This method can be complemented by constructing estimated [[confidence interval for two means|confidence intervals]] around population means and comparing confidence intervals to figure out the relationship between population means.
