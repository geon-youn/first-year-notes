# Compilation
## Compilation into Machine Code
The [[program]] can be **compiled** into **native machine code**.
### Advantage
- The machine code is **optimized** to run fast.
### Disadvantage
- Code development is much more difficult.
## Compilation into Byte Code
The program can be **compiled** into **byte code** for a virtual machine that is either [[interpretation|interpreted]] or compiled.
### Advantage
- Programs are more portable.
### Disadvantage
- Byte code is slower than native code.
