# Fields
Fields are sets with the following 16 **field axioms** (similar to [[real numbers]] and [[integers]])[^1]
1. [[closure under addition and multiplication]]
2. [[associativity]]
3. [[commutativity]]
4. [[distributivity]]
5. [[identities of zero and one]]
6. [[additive inverse]]s
7. [[subtraction]]
8. [[multiplicative inverse]]s
9. [[division]]
10. [[no divisors of zero]]
11. [[cancellation]]
12. [[transitive property of inequalities]]
13. [[trichotomy]]
14. [[order property 1]]
15. [[order property 2]]
16. [[order property 3]]

Two fields can be differentiated by the [[completeness axiom]].
