# Centre
**Mean**: a natural summary and the centre point of a [[shape|unimodal]] and symmetric distribution. 

To find the mean of a variable $y$, add all the values of the [[data value|variable]] and divide that sum by the number of data values $n$. 

**Sample mean**: denoted by $\overline{y}$. 

$$\overline{y}=\frac{\sum^n_{i=1}y_i}{n}$$

**Population mean**: denoted by $\mu$. 

If a distribution is skewed, contains gaps, or contains outliers, then it might be better to use the **median**: the value that splits the [[displaying qualitative data|histogram]] into two *equal* areas - the middle value in the data. 

The median is said to be **resistant** because it isn't affected by unusual observations or by the shape of the distribution (like outliers). 

If a distribution is rougly symmetric, we'd expect the mean and median to be close.
