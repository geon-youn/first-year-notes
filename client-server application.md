# Components of a Client-Server Application
There are four components of a [[client]]-[[server]] application:
1. Communication protocol (e.g., http);
2. Server running a server program (e.g., web server);
3. One or more clients running client programs (e.g., web browser);
4. Communication channels via [[TCP]] or UDP.
