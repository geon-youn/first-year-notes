# Population and parameters
**Census**: a sample that includes observations from the entire population. A census is usually not the best idea since
- difficult or impractical or cumbersome to perform one
- population characteristics may change
    - we can't perform censuses often

**Parameters**: key numbers in models that represent reality. A parameter is constant, although its value may be unknown.

**Population parameter**: a parameter used in a model for a population.

Since we're taking samples, we need to estimate population parameters through the sample data. 

**Sample statistics**: anything calculated from a sample.

**Sample average (statistic; sample proportion)**: a [[random variable]] $\hat{p}$ whose value depends on the chosen random sample. 

**Estimator (point estimator)**: A statistic used to make inferences about the population parameter.

**Representative sample statistic**: a sample statistic estimates the corresponding populationi parameter accurately.
