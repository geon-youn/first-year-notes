# Divide and Conquer
Divide a problem into its simplest parts at which it already is a solution. Then, work backwards using this fact to solve a larger problem. 
1. The simplest instances of the problem are solved directly.
2. Each other instance of the problem is solved by reducing the instance to simpler instances of the problem. 
3. As a result of 1 and 2, each instance can be solved by reducing the instance to simpler instances and then reducing these instances to simpler instances and continuing in this fashion until a simplest instance is reached, which has already been solved.
