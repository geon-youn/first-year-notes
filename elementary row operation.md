# Elementary Row Operations
There are three **elementary row operations** we can apply to a matrix:
1. [[replacement|Replacement]];
2. [[scaling|Scaling]] by $c\in\mathbb{R}$, where $c\neq 0$;
3. [[interchanging|Interchanging]]. 

We typically perform these operations to make matrices easier to work with. Typically, we want them in either [[row echelon form]] or [[reduced row echelon form]].
