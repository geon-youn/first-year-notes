# Machine Integers
Machine integers are [[integers]] that are represented with a **fixed** number of bits. There are two approaches to machine integers:
1. [[signed magnitude approach]];
2. [[two's complement]]

Arithmetic operations like addition and multiplication on machine integers can cause **overflow**.
