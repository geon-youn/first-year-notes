# Functions of three or more variables
A **function of three variables** $f$ is a rule that assigns to each ordered tuple $(x, y, z)$ in a domain $D\subset \mathbb{R}^3$ a unique real number denoted by $f(x,y,z)$.

It's difficult to visualize a function $f$ of three variables by its graph like with [[functions of two variables]], but we can gain some insight using **level surfaces**, which are the surfaces with equations $f(x, y, z) = k$, where $k$ is a constant.  

A **function of $n$ variables** is a rule that assigns a number $z=f(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n)$ to a $n$-tuple $(x_1, x_2,\dots, x_n)$ of real numbers. We denote $\mathbb{R}^n$ the set of all such $n$-tuples. The function $f$ is a real-valued function whose domain is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. 

Sometimes we use vector notation to write $f$ more compactly. If $\boldsymbol{x}=\langle x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n\rangle$, we often write $f(\boldsymbol{x})$ instead of $f(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n)$. 

So, we have three ways of looking at a function $f$ defined on a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$:
1. As a function of $n$ real variables $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n$.
2. As a function of a single point variable $(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n$.
3. As a function of a single vector variable $\boldsymbol{x}=\langle x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n\rangle$.
