# Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
The sampling distribution of any [[centre|mean]] becomes [[normal distribution|normal]] as the sample size grows. 

This is true **regardless of the shape of the population distribution**. 

For large enough sample sizes (at least 30), sampling distribution of [[sample mean]]s can be approximated by a normal model. The larger the sample, the better the approximation will be.
