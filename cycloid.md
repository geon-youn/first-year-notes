# Cycloid
The curve traced out by a point $P$ on the circumference of a circle as the circle rolls along a straight line is called a **cycloid**. If the circle has radius $r$ and rolls along the $x$ axis and if one position of $P$ is the origin, then its [[parametric equation]]s are:

$$\begin{array}{ccc}
x=r(\theta-\sin\theta) & y = r(1 - \cos\theta) & \theta\in\mathbb{R}
\end{array}$$

where our parameter is the angle of rotation $\theta$ of the circle ($\theta=0$ at the origin).
