# Blinding and placebos 
**Blinding**: the deliberate witholding of the treatments details from individuals who might affect the outcome.

Two sources of unwanted bias:
1. Those who might influence the results (subjects, treatment administrators, technicians, etc)
2. Those two evaluate the results (judges, experimenters, etc)
    - Single-blind experiment: one or the other groups is blinded.
    - Double-blind experiment: both groups are blinded.
    
**Placebo**: often, applying any treatment can alter a response. To separate the real treatment effects from imagined ones, use an ineffective control treatment that mimics the treatments being tested.
