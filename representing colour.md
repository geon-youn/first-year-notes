# Models for Representing Colour
## RGB model
The RGB model is an **additive** model for representing colour on a monitor screen. A colour is a sum of three colours (red, green, and blue). A colour is often represented as three 8-bit bytes (000000 to FFFFFF in hexadecimal). No colour is black and full colour is white.  
## CMYK model
The CMYK model is a **subtractive** model for printing colour using ink. A colour is produced by absorbing light (colour) with four inks:
1. Cyan ink absorbs red (cyan = green + blue).
2. Magenta ink absorbs green (magenta = red + blue).
3. Yellow ink absorbs blue (yellow = red + green).
4. Black absorbs all colours (not needed, but included to get sharp black).

Complete absorption is black and no absorption is white (assuming base is white).
