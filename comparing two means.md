# Comparing two means
For two groups, the [[population and parameters|statistic]] of interest is the difference in the observed [[centre|mean]] of the two groups:

$$\overline{y}_1-\overline{y}_2$$

From this *estimate*, we would like to find the difference between the two population means:

$$\mu_1-\mu_2$$

We need the standard distribution model and standard deviation of the difference in their means. Once we know those, we can build a [[confidence interval]] and [[hypothesis testing|test a hypothesis]] like we did for a [[confidence interval and hypothesis testing for the population mean|single mean]].

For that, we can use a [[variance|simple rule]]:

> If the sample means come from *independent samples*, the variance of their sum or difference is the sum of their variances.

As long as the two groups are independent, we find the standard deviation of the difference between the two sample means by adding their variances and then taking the square root.

$$\begin{align*}Var(\overline{y}_1-\overline{y}_2)&=Var(\overline{y}_1)+Var(\overline{y}_2)\\
SD(\overline{y}_1-\overline{y}_2)&=\sqrt{Var(\overline{y}_1)+Var(\overline{y}_2)}\end{align*}$$

> If $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ are known: $$SD(\overline{y}_1-\overline{y}_2)=\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1}+\frac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}$$

> If $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ are unknown: $$SE(\overline{y}_1-\overline{y}_2)=\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1}+\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}$$

When the conditions are met, the standardized sample difference between the means of two independent groups can be approximated by a [[confidence interval and hypothesis testing for the population mean|Student's t-model]] with an adjusted degrees of freedom value found with a special formula. 

> $$t=\frac{(\overline{y}_1-\overline{y}_2)-(\mu_1-\mu_2)}{SE(\overline{y}_1-\overline{y}_2)}$$

## Two-sample t-test

To construct the hypothesis test for the difference of the means, we start by hypothesizing a value for the true difference of the means. We call that hypothesized difference $\Delta_0$. It's so common for $\Delta_0$ to be zero that we often just assume $\Delta_0=0$:

$$\left\{\begin{array}{l}H_0:\mu_1-\mu_2=\Delta_0\\H_A:\mu_1-\mu_2\neq\Delta_0\end{array}\right.$$

The t-score for the two-sample t-test becomes

> $$t=\frac{(\overline{y}_1-\overline{y}_2)-\Delta_0}{SE(\overline{y}_1-\overline{y}_2)}$$

With degree of freedom:

> $$df=\frac{\left(\frac{s_1^2}{n_1}+\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}\right)^2}{\frac{1}{n_1-1}\left(\frac{s_1^2}{n_1}\right)^2+\frac{1}{n_2-1}\left(\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}\right)^2}$$

If using a table, round down. 

### Assumptions and conditions
- The data in each group must be drawn **independently and at random** from each group's own homogeneous population or generated by a randomized comparative experiment.
- The underlying populations are **each normally distributed**.
- Each group must be **nearly normally distributed**.
