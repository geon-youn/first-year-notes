# Null Space
Given an $n \times n$ matrix $A$, its **null space** is the set of all [[vector|vectors]] that is a solution to $A$'s [[homogeneity|homogeneous]] equation such that
$$\operatorname{Nul}A=\left\{\vec{x}\in \mathbb{R}^n : A\vec{x}=\vec{0}\right\}$$

```ad-note
The null space of an $m \times n$ matrix $A$ is a [[subspace]] of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Equivalently, the set of all solutions to a system $A\vec{x}=\vec{0}$ of $m$ homogeneous linear equations in $n$ unknowns is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$. 
If $A$'s null space is equal to the zero vector, then $A$ is [[one-to-one]].
```

```ad-tip
The null space of a [[linear transformation]] is exactly the null space of its [[standard matrix]].
