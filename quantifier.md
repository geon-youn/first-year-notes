# Quantifiers
Quantifiers come in two forms:
1. For all ($\forall$).
2. Exists ($\exists$).

They are included in the [[universe]] for a [[predicate]]. For all requires the predicate to be true for all specified values. Exists requires only one value to exist such that the predicate is true for that value.

When using a [[statement]] of the form $(\exists x)P(x)$, we **fix** $x$ such that $P(x)$ is true (called **existential instantiation**).

When proving a statement of the form $(\forall x)P(x)$, we begin by **fixing** an **arbitrary** $x$.
