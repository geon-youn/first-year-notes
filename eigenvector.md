# Eigenvectors
Let $T : V \mapsto V$ be a [[linear transformation]]. Then, $\vec{v}\neq\vec{0}$ is an **eigenvector** for $T$ if $T\vec{v}=\lambda\vec{v}$ for some $\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$. The scalar $\lambda$ is the associated [[eigenvalue]].

```ad-warning
title: For linear algebra...
We mainly consider matrix transformations by a matrix $A$ and thus the equation $A\vec{v}=\lambda\vec{v}$.

```ad-question
title: What about zero vectors?
Zero vectors can never be eigenvectors.
