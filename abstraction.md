# Abstraction
The process of focusing on what is important while ignoring what is irrelevant. Abstraction is a special case of [[separation of concerns]]. Abstraction produces a *model* of an entity in which the irrelevant details of the entity are left out.
- Many different models of the same entity can be produced by abstraction.
- Abstraction models differ from each other by what is considered important and irrelevant.
- Repeated application of abstraction produces a hierarchy of models.

## Over-abstraction
Over abstraction produces models that are difficult to understand because they are missing too many details.
