# Modularity
A **modular system** is a complex system that is divided into smaller parts called **modules**. Modularity enables the principle of [[separation of concerns]] to be applied in two ways:
1. Different parts of a system are considered separately.
2. The parts of the system are considered separately from their composition.
## Modular Decomposition
The *top-down* process of dividing a system into modules. It uses a [[divide and conquer]] approach. 
## Modular Composition
The *bottom-up* process of building a system out of modules. It uses an [[interchangeable parts]] approach.
