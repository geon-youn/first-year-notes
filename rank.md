# Rank
The **rank** of a matrix $A$ is the [[dimension]] of $A$'s [[column space]]. 

```ad-info
title: Nomenclature
$\text{rank}A\equiv \text{dim Col}A$
```

```ad-tip
title: Alternative explanation
Rank = the number of [[pivot column|pivot columns]] in $A$
```

```ad-note
title: Useful identity
The rank of $A$ is equal to the rank of $A$ [[transpose]]: $\text{rank}A=\text{rank}A^{\text{T}}$.
In other words, the dimension of $A$'s column space is equal to the dimension of $A$'s [[row space]].
```
