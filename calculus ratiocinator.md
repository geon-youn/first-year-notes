# Calculus Ratiocinator
A [[computing]] device that could determine the truth or falsity of statements expressed in the [[characteristica universalis]].

```ad-warning
The calculus ratiocinator is theoretically impossible. **Alonzo Church** and **Alan Turing** showed independently that there are undecidable decision problems. The work of Church and Turing were heavily influenced by **Kurt Godel**'s proofs of his first and second incompleteness theorems.
