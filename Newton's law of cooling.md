# Newton's law of cooling
Newton's law of cooling states that the rate of cooling of an object is proportional to the temperature difference between the object and its surroundings, provided that this difference is not too large (this law also applies to warming). If we let $T(t)$ be the temperature of an object at time $t$ and $T_s$ be the temperature of the surroundings, we can have the [[differential equation]]
$$\frac{dT}{dt}=k(T-T_s)$$
where $k$ is a constant. To make it similar to the [[law of natural growth]], we use a change of variables $y(t)=T(t)-T_s$. Because $T_s$ is a constant, we have $y'(t)=T'(t)$:
$$\frac{dy}{dt}=ky$$
