# Function Composition
Let $f:X \mapsto Y$ and $g:A \mapsto B$ be [[First Year/function]]s with $Y \subseteq A$.

The **composition** of $f:X \mapsto Y$ and $g:A \mapsto B$ is the function

$$g \circ f : X \mapsto B$$

which is equivalent to

$$g \circ f(x) = g(f(x))\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\forall{x\in{X}}$$

Composition reads right to left: first $f$ then $g$.

## Alternative Explanation
Think of the $\circ$ as "of". So $g\circ f$ is $g$ of $f$. That is, we apply $g$ onto the result after we applied $f$.
