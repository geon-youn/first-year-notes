# Alonzo Church
An American mathematician, logician, and computer scientist. He developed a model of computation called **lambda calculus** based on function application and abstraction. Using lambda calculus, he showed that there is an **undecidable decision problem**. He used this result to show that **[[calculus ratiocinator|first-order logic is undecidable]]** (called **Curch's theorem**). He is also known for the **Church-Turing thesis** and the **Church-Rosser theorem**.
