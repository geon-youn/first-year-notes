# Digital Audio
**Digital audio** is produced from a continuous sound wave by periodic **sampling** and discrete **quantization**. Sounds outside human perception are eliminated. Audio files are [[data compression|compressed]] to reduce size without significantly reducing sound quality. The higher the frequency (bit rate), the truer the sound to the original source.
