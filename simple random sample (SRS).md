# Simple random sample (SRS)
**Simple random sample (SRS)**: a [[sampling|sample]] drawn so that every possible *sample* of the size we plan to draw has an equal chance of being selected.

To select a sample at random, a sampling frame is first defined. 

**Sampling frame**: a list of individuals (or [[data value|case]]s, record, etc.) from which the sample will be drawn.

Once we have a sampling frame, we can assign a sequential number to each individual in the sampling frame and draw random numbers to identify those to be sampled. 

Other random sample designs include:
- [[stratified sampling]]
- [[cluster sampling]]
- [[systematic sampling]]
- [[multistage sampling]]
