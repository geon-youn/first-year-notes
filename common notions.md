# Common Notions
Assumptions we agree on about how quantities work.

[A1]: If $A=B$ and $B=C$, then $A=C$ by the transitive property.
[A2/A3]: If $A=C$ and $B=D$, then $A\pm B=C\pm D$.
[A4/5]: If $A>C$ and $B=D$, then $A\pm B>C\pm D$.
[A6]: If $A=B$, then $2A=2B$.
[A7]: If $A=B$, then $A/2=B/2$. 
[A8]: The whole is equal to the sum of its parts, and each of the parts is smaller than the whole. 
[A9]: If two objects can be translated, rotated, or reflected to coincide with another, then they are equal or [[congruent]].

title: The more "technical" wording
1. Things that are equal to the same thing are equal to each other.
2. If equals are added to equals, the sums are equal.
3. If equals are subtracted to equals, the remainders are equal.
4. If equals are added to unequals, the sums are unequal. The greater sum is obtained from the greater unequal. 
5. If equals are taken from unequals, the remainders are unequal. The greater remainder is obtained from the greater unequal.
6. If equals are doubled, the results are equal.
7. If equals are halved, the results are equal.
8. If the whole consists of more than one part, then the whole is greater than each of its parts and is equal to the sum of its parts.
9. Things that can be made to coincide with one another are equal to one another.
