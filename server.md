# Servers
**Servers** are [[process]]es that provide [[internet service|services]] over a network. They usually listen at a particular reserved [[TCP]] or UDP port. They may participate in more than one TCP connection at the same time. Servers are often called **daemons** and are given a name that ends with a d (e.g. `httpd`). A server may be organized as a group of processes or threads. 

Servers are usually more complex than [[client]]s. The burden of security mostly falls on the server.
