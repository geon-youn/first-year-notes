# Image
The **image** is the value in the codomain that is returned when a value in the domain is passed into a [[First Year/function]].

# Preimage
The **preimage** is the x value for a y value. 

```ad-example
Given $f(1)=B$ and $f(3)=B$, the image of $1$ is $B$ and the preimage of $B$ is $\{1,3\}$.
