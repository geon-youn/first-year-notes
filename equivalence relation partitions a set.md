# Equivalence relation partitions a set
Let $R$ be an [[equivalence relation]] on a set $A$. The [[union]] of all the [[equivalence class]]es of $R$ equal to $A$, since an element $a$ of $A$ is in its own equivalence class $[a]_R$. 

> $$\bigcup_{a\in A}[a]_R=A$$

By the definition of equivalence classes, if $[a]_R\neq[b]_R$, then $[a]_R\cap [b]_R=\emptyset$.

Therefore, the equivalence classes form a [[partition of a set|partition]] of $A$, because they split $A$ into [[probability|disjoint]] [[subset]]s.
