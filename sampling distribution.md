# Sampling distribution
**Sampling distribution**: a [[random variable|probability distribution]] of a [[population and parameters|statistic]] obtained from a larger number of samples drawn from a specific population.

 There are two types of sample distributions depending on the kind of [[data value|data]] we're dealing with.  
 
 When we have [[types of variables|categorical]] data, we calculate a [[sample proportion]] $\hat{p}$. Its sampling distribution follows a [[normal distribution]] with a [[centre|mean]] at the population proportion $\mu(\hat{p})=p$ and a [[spread|standard deviation]] $SD(\hat{p})=\sqrt\frac{p(1-p}{n}$. 
 
 When we have [[types of variables|quantitative]] data, we calculate a [[sample mean]] $\overline{y}$. Its sampling distribution has a normal distribution with a mean at the population mean $\mu$ with a standard deviation $SD(\overline{y})=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$.
