# The Rank Theorem
For a matrix $A$, the sum of its [[rank]] and [[nullity]] is equal to its [[dimension]]. 

```ad-abstract
title: Proof
Claim: $\text{rank}A+\text{nullity}A=\text{dim}A=n$.
We know:
1. $\text{rank}A$    = # of pivot columns;
2. $\text{nullity}A$ = # of non-pivot columns;
3. $\text{dim}A$     = # of columns.

So, $n$ must be equal to the sum of the number of pivot and non-pivot columns.
```
