# Polar coordinate system
We choose a point in the plane called the **pole** or (origin) and is labelled $O$. Then, we draw a ray (half-line) starting at $O$ called the **polar axis**. This axis is usually drawn horizontally to the right and corresponds to the positive x-axis in Cartesian coordinates.

If $P$ is any other point in the plane, let $r$ be the distance from $O$ to $P$ and let $\theta$ be the angle between the polar axis and the line $OP$. Then the point $P$ is represented by the ordered pair $(r, \theta)$ and 

> $r, \theta$ are called **polar coordinates** of $P$.

We use the convention that an angle is positive if measured counterclockwise from the polar axis and negative in the clockwise direction.

If $P=O$, then $r=0$ and we agree that $(0,\theta)$ represents the pole for any value of $\theta$. 

When $r$ is negative, the points $(-r, \theta)$ and $(r, \theta)$ lie on the same line through $O$ and at the same distance $|r|$ from $O$ but on opposite sides. If $r > 0$, the point $(r,\theta)$ lies in the same quadrant as $\theta$. If $r < 0$, it lies in the quadrant on the opposite side of the pole.

$$(-r,\theta)=(r,\theta + \pi)$$
