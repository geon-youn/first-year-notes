# Experiment design
An **experiment** is a study in which the experimenter **manipulates** attributes of the study participants and observes the consequences.

The attributes, called **factors**, are manipulated by being set particular values called **levels**. These levels are assigned or allocated to individuals in the study.

The combination of factor levels assigned to a subject is called that subject's **treatment**.

Two key features:
- the experimenter actively and deliberately manipulates the factors to specify a treatment.
- the experiment assigns subjects to the treatments **randomly**

1. Randomize. Assign treatments to subjects randomly.
2. Control. We control sources of variation other than the factors we're testing by making conditions as similar as possible for all treatment groups. 
    - A **control treatment** is a special treatment class designed to mark the baseline of the study, and the group that receives it is called the **control group**.
3. Replicate. Repeated observations at each treatment are called **replicates**. If the number of replicates is the same for each treatment combination, the experiment is said to be **balanced**.
    - A special kind of replication is to repeat an entire experiment for a different group of subjects, under different circumstances, or at a different time. 
4. Block. Group or **block** subjects together according to some factor that *you cannot control* and *feel may affect the response*. Such factors are called **blocking factors** and their levels are called **blocks**. 
    - Blocking an experiment into $n$ blocks is equivalent to running $n$ separate experiments. 
    
When each of the possible treatments is assigned to at least one subject at random, the design is called a **completely randomized design**.

**Randomized block designs**: when we have a blocking factor, we randomize the subject to treatments within each block.

**Factorial designs**: an experiment with more than one manipulated factor. 

A **full factorial design** contains treatments that represent all possible combinations of all levels of all factors.

**Interaction**: when the combination of two factors has a different effect than you'd expect by adding the effects of the two factors together.
- Unless your experiment incorporates a factorial design, you can't see interactions.
