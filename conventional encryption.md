# Conventional Encryption
The use of a single **key** to go from plaintext to ciphertext using two algorithms; one for **encryption** and another for **decryption**. The main assumption is that computation of the plaintext from the ciphertext is mathematically infeasible without the key. The security of this process depends primarily on *maintaining the secrecy of the key*.
