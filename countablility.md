# Countability
A [[set]] $X$ is **countable** if $X$ is finite or $|X|=|\mathbb{N}|$ (its [[cardinality]] is equal to the cardinality of the [[natural numbers]]). 

Let $X$ be an infinite set, then $X$ is **countably infinite** (or **denumerable**) if $|X|=|\mathbb{N}|$. Then we say $|X|=\aleph_0$ read as "aleph null."

$X$ is **uncountable** if $X$ is *not* countable (e.g. [[real numbers]]). 

# Functions
Let $X$ and $Y$ be sets and let $f:X\mapsto Y$ be a [[First Year/function]]. 
- If $Y$ is countable and $f$ is [[injective]], then $X$ is countable.
	- If $X$ is uncountable, then $Y$ is uncountable or $f$ is not injective.
- If $X$ is countable and $f$ is [[surjective]], then $Y$ is countable.
	- If $Y$ is uncountable, then $X$ is uncountable or $f$ is not surjective.
