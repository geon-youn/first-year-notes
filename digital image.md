# Digital Images
Images that are captured and stored digitally as a sequence of bits. 

A **digital display** consists of a rectangular grid of **pixels**. The **resolution** of the display is the grid dimensions. **Raster graphics** represents an image as a grid of pixels. Raster images are usually compressed to save space using one or more formats. 

**Vector graphics** represent an image as geometric object in a coordinate system. Vector images are usually smaller, and faster than raster images. Vector graphics is used for representing **scalable** images.
