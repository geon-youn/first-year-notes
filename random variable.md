# Random variable
**Random variable**: a measure that represents the outcome of a random event (and the outcome is random). A random variable (usually denoted by $X$) could be
- **discrete**, in which it assumes a [[countablility|countable]] number of distinct values
- **continuous**, in which it assumes an uncountable number of distinct values

Every random variable is associated with a probability distribution. Probability distributions capture the randomness inherent in random variables.

| Discrete                             | Continuous                           |

**Expected value ($E(X)$)**: weighted average of the outcomes of a random variable. 
- NOT the most probably value of the random variable. 
- MAY NOT even be one of the possible values of the random variable.
