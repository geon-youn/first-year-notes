# Domain Names
A **domain name** consists of a sequence of **labels** separated by dots. Each suffix of a domain name is also a domain name. A domain name denotes a set of one (called a **host name**) or more hosts. A host name looks no different than a domain name denoting a collection of hosts. A host only has a domain name if it is registered with some domain in the [[domain name system]].
