# Sequences
An ordered list of elements created by a function mapping the integers to a set $S$, where $a_n$ represents the $n$th term and $\{a_n\}$ is the sequence.

## Notation
The sequence $\{a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots\}$ is also denoted by
$$\{a_n\}$$
or
$$\{a_n\}^\infty_{n=1}$$
Unless otherwise stated, we assume that $n$ starts at $1$. 

## Arithmetic Sequence
A sequence where there is a common difference between the terms.
$$a_{n+1}=a_n+d$$
$$\{a_n\}=a+nd$$

## Geometric Sequence
A sequence where there is a common ratio between the terms.
$$a_{n+1}=a_nr$$
$$\{a_n\}=ar^{n-1}$$
