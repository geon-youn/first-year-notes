# Functional
[[program|Programs]] are mostly [[declarative]]; a program is a collection of **side-effect free** function definitions. Results are produced by **evaluating expressions** built from functions. Functions are defined as **first-class values** and used as **rules**. **Recursion** plays a crucial role. **State change** and **data mutation** are avoided as much as possible. 
## Advantages
- The meaning of a program is **simpler** and much more **explicit**.
- **Testing and reasoning** about programs is much simpler.
- Expressions can be **safely moved around** in the code.
- Code is more **compact**.
- Evaluations can be **performed in parallel**.
