# Sampling
## Why do we take samples?
- Insight into behaviours of a population.
- Population is big.
- Observing the whole population is impossible or costly or too time consuming.
- Only a sample of the population is observable.

## Features
### Examine a part of the whole
We may use **sample surveys**: questions designed to give us answers on some characteristics of the sample.

Samples may be **biased**: a biased sample over- or under-emphasises certain characteristics of the population.

A biased sample gives us biased understanding of the characteristics of the population.

Individuals ([[data value|case]]s) for samples must be selected **randomly**.

### Randomize
Randomizing protects us by giving us a representative sample even for effects we were unaware of. 

**Sampling variability**: sample-to-sample differences.

### Sample size is important
The **size of the sample** determines what we can conclude from the data **regardless of the size of the population**. 

How big a sample do we need? It depends on what we are estimating (but usually >30 cases). Too small sample size may not be representative of the population. Naturally, we prefer a sample that is a good representative of the population and is as small as possible.
