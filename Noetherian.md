# Noetherian 
A total order (S, <) is **Noetherian** if there are no infinite descending sequences of members of S of the form
$$\cdots < x_n < \cdots < x_1 < x_0$$

Noetherian is named after [[Amalie Emmy Noether]] because she was the first to study the ascending and descending chain conditions for rings.
