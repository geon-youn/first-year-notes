# Logical Equivalence
If two expressions have the same [[truth table]], then they have the same logical meaning. In this case, we say that the expressions are **logically equivalent**.

```ad-example
Given a set of logically equivalent statements, if even one of them are false, then the rest are false. Similarly, if even one of them is true, then the rest are true. 
```

## Alternative Explanation
Two propositions $P$ and $Q$ are logically equivalent if $P\Leftrightarrow Q$ is a [[tautology]].
