# The Basis Theorem
Let $V$ be a $p$-dimensional [[vector space]] where $p\ge 1$.
Then:
1. Any [[independent set theorem|linearly independent set]] of $p$ vectors is a [[basis]].
2. Any [[spanning set theorem|spanning set]] of $p$ vectors is a [[basis]].

## Proof
1. Use [[independent set theorem]].
2. Use [[spanning set theorem]].

```ad-tip
title: tl;dr
The Basis Theorem is a convenient way (that usually works) for producing a basis if you know the dimension of the space.
