# Biconditional
The **biconditional** of an [[First Year/implication]] $P \Rightarrow Q$ is the expression $(P \Rightarrow Q)\wedge(Q \Rightarrow P)$ which is written as $P \Leftrightarrow Q$. This statement is equivalent to saying the implication is equivalent to its [[converse]].  The biconditional is true iff both $P$ and $Q$ are true or both false.
