# Power Set
A **power set** of a [[set]] contains all possible [[subset]]s in a set. 

```ad-example
The power set of $\left\{0, 1, 2\right\}$ is $\left\{\left\{\right\},\left\{0\right\},\left\{1\right\},\left\{2\right\},\left\{0,1\right\},\left\{0,2\right\},\left\{1,2\right\},\left\{0,1,2\right\}\right\}$

The power set of a set $A$ is denoted as $P(A)$.
```

A power set of a set that contains $n$ elements contains $2^n$ elements i.e. its [[cardinality]].
