# Eigenspace
To every [[eigenvalue]], we know that there must be at least one nonzero [[eigenvector]] associated to it, but there may also be many (if the [[multiplicity]] of that eigenvalue is greater than 1). The set of all eigenvectors for a given eigenvalue forms a [[subspace]], which we will call the **eigenspace**. So, the eigenspace must also contain the zero vector.  
$$\operatorname{Eigenspace}(\lambda_k)=\left\{\vec{0},\vec{p_1},\dots,\vec{p_n}\right\}$$
where $\vec{p_1},\dots,\vec{p_n}$ are the eigenvectors for the eigenvalue $\lambda_k$. The value of $p$ is less than or equal to the multiplicity of the eigenvalue.
