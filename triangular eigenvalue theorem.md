# Eigenvalue Calculation For a Triangular Matrix
If a matrix $A$ is [[triangular]], then the [[eigenvalue|eigenvalues]] of $A$ are its diagonal entries.

```ad-abstract
title: Proof
Since $A$ is triangular, its [[main diagonal]] is $(a_{11}-\lambda,\dots,a_{nn}-\lambda)$. So, $A$'s [[determinant]] is $0$ iff at least one of its entries in the main diagonal is $0$. Therefore $A$'s eigenvalues are the values of its [[main diagonal]].
