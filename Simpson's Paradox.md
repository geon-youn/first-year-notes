# Simpson's Paradox
**Simpson's Paradox**: when certain trends appears in several different groups of data, but disappears or reverses when these groups are combined. Results from inappropriately combining percentages of different groups. 

Possible reasons:
- size of groups: when the effect of the difference in groups is ignored, the groups with a higher sample size have a greater influence on the combined results, proportionate to their size.
- the lurking [[data value|variable]] (**confounding variable**) that influences the results when two groups with significantly different behaviours are combined. 

How to avoid:
- review [[frequency table]].
- review correlation among variables.
- investigate any lurking variables that may result in significant differences between groups.
- a comprehensive and deep level of content knowledge (**domain knowledge**).
