# Probability of an event
The probability of the [[Pierre-Simon Laplace's classical theory of probability|event]] $E$ is the sum of the probabilities of the outcomes in $E$:

> $$p(E)=\sum_{s\in S}p(s)$$

These probabilities can be [[uniform distribution|uniform]] or [[assigning probabilities|nonuniform]].

```ad-note
No assumption is being made about the distribution.
