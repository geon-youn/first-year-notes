# Linear Transformations
Let $T : \mathbb{R}^n \mapsto \mathbb{R}^n$ be a [[First Year/function]]. Then, $T$ is **linear** if
1. $T(\vec{u}+\vec{v}) = T(\vec{u}) + T(\vec{v})$ for all $\vec{u}$, $\vec{v}$ in the domain of $T$;
2. $T(c \vec{u}) = cT(\vec{u})$ for all scalars $c$ and all $\vec{u}$ in the domain of $T$. 

```ad-tip
By the second condition, the zero vector **must** be included in the codomain of $T$. 
```

# Linear Transformations for Functions
The **derivative** is a linear transformation, but it only has [[eigenvalue]]s when the degree of $\frac{dp}{dx}$ is equal to the degree of $p$, where $p$ is a function.
