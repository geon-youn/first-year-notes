# Set Complement
Let $A$ and $B$ be [[set]]s. The **complement of A in B** (also called the **difference of B and A**) is 
$$B\setminus A=B-A=\left\{x\in B|x\notin A\right\}=B\cap\overline{A}$$

The complement of $A$ in the [[universe]] $U$ is simply the **complement of A**
$$\overline{A}=A^\text{c}=U-A$$

The complement of a complement is the original set
$$\overline{\overline{A}}=A$$
