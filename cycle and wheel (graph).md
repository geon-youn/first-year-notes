# Cycle and wheel (graph)
A **cycle** $C_n$ for $n\geq 3$ consists of $n$ vertices $v_1,v_2,\dots,v_n$ and edges $\left\{v_1,v_2\right\}, \left\{v_2,v_3\right\}, \dots, \left\{v_{n-1},v_n\right\},\left\{v_n,v_1\right\}$.

A **wheel** $W_n$ is obtained by adding an additional vertex to a cycle and connecting this new vertex to each of the $n$ vertices by new edges.
