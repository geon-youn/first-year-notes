# Linearly independent set
$S\equiv\{\vec{v_i}\}^{p}_{i=1}\subset{V}$ vector space is [[linear dependence|linearly independent]] if the only solution to a [[linear combination]] of vectors in $S$ such that $c_1\vec{v_1}+\dots+c_p\vec{v_p}=\vec{0}$ is all $c_j=0$ (i.e. the [[trivial solution]]), then $S$ is a **linearly independent set**.
