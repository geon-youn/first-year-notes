# Spread
We need to determine how spread out the data are because the more the data vary, the less a measure of centre can tell us. 

**Range**: the difference between the extremes: `range = max - min`.  

Range is a weak measure since it only considers the two endpoints of the data. The range is not resistant to unusual observations and outlisers because if you have outliers, the min or max would be the outliers.

Each **quartile** is a value that frames the middle 50% of the data. One-quarter of the data lies below the lower quartile Q1, and one-quarter lies above the third quartile Q3. 

**Interquartile range (IQR)**: the difference between Q3 and Q1: `IQR = Q3 - Q1`. 

**Variance**: the average of squared deviation between data points and the mean; units: `(units of data)^2`.

**Sample variance**: denoted by $s^2=\frac{\sum(y_i-\overline{y})^2}{n-1}$

**Population variance**: denoted by $\sigma^2=\frac{\sum(y_i-\mu)^2}{N}$

**Standard deviation**: on average, how far data points are from the mean; units: `units of data`. 

**Sample standard deviation**: denoted by $s=\sqrt {s^2}=\sqrt\frac{\sum(y_i-\overline{y})^2}{n-1}$

**Population standard deviation**: denoted by $\sigma= \sqrt{\sigma^2}=\sqrt\frac{\sum(y_i-\mu)^2}{N}$

**Coefficient of variation (CV)**: a measure of relative spread taken as standard deviation divided by mean.

**Sample CV**: denoted by $CV=\frac{s}{\overline{y}}$

**Population CV**: denoted by $CV=\frac{\sigma}{\mu}$
