# The Completeness Axiom
Let $A\subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

If $A$ is non-empty and $A$ is [[bound|bounded above]], then $A$ has a [[supremum and infemum|supremum]].

If $A$ is non-empty and $A$ is [[bound|bounded below]], then $A$ has a [[supremum and infemum|infemum]]. 

```ad-question
title: Why must $A$ be non-empty?
If $A$ was empty, then there are infinite upper/lower bounds, so there is no least/greatest upper/lower bound, thus there is no supremum/infemum.
