# Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)
A GUI enables a user to access the operating system or other program via a graphical display. The display consists of a **root window** and various other windows and objects that are placed on the root window. The user interacts with the GUI by initiating **events** with a mouse or keyboard. The event that occurs depends on the **[[input focus]]**.  The GUI **handles** the events as they occur, thus it runs as an infinite loop.
## Advantages
- GUIs require a large portion of a computer's resources
- GUIs can be extremely complex
## Disadvantages
- GUIs are relatively easier to use than [[command-line interface|CLIs]].
