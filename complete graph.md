# Complete graph
A **complete graph on $n$ vertices**, denoted by $K_n$, is the [[graph|simple graph]] that contains exactly one edge between each pair of distinct vertices. 

For all vertices $u, v$ where $u\neq v$, there exists an edge $(u, v)$. 

There's $n$ vertices, and it can link to $n-1$ vertices, so 

$$2m=n(n-1)\Rightarrow m = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}=\binom{n}{2}$$
