# Composition relation
Suppose $R_1$ is a [[binary relation|relation]] from a set $A$ to a set $B$ and $R_2$ is a relation from $B$ to a set $C$. Then, the **[[composition]]** (or **composite**) of $R_2$ with $R_1$ is a new relation from $A$ to $C$ where if $(x, y)$ is a member of $R_1$ and $(y, z)$ is a member of $R_2$, then $(x, z)$ is a member of $R_1\circ R_2$ (using properties of [[transitive relation]]s).
