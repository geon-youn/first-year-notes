# Second partial derivative
If $f$ is a [[functions of two variables]], then its [[partial derivative of f with respect to x at (a, b)|partial derivatives]] $f_x$ and $f_y$ are also functions of two variables, so we can consider their partial derivatives $(f_x)_x$, $(f_x)_y$, $(f_y)_x$, and $(f_y)_y$, which are called the **second partial derivatives** of $f$. If $z=f(x,y)$, 

> $$\begin{align*}
(f_x)_x&=f_{xx}=f_{11}=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right)=\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x^2}=\frac{\partial^2z}{\partial x^2}\\
(f_x)_y&=f_{xy}=f_{12}=\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right)=\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial y\,\partial x}=\frac{\partial^2z}{\partial y\,\partial x}\\
(f_y)_x&=f_{yx}=f_{21}=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right)=\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x\, \partial y}=\frac{\partial^2z}{\partial x\,\partial y}\\
(f_y)_y&=f_{yy}=f_{22}=\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right)=\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial y^2}=\frac{\partial^2z}{\partial y^2}\\
\end{align*}$$
