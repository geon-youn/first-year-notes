# Upper and Lower Bounds of Sets
$u\in\mathbb{R}$ is an **upper bound** of a [[set]] $A$ if for all $a\in A$, $a\leq u$. 

$l\in\mathbb{R}$ is a **lower bound** of $A$ if for all $a\in A$, $a\leq l$. 

$A$ is **bounded above** if there exists an upper bound of $A$.

$A$ is **bounded below** if there exists a lower bound of $A$.

$A$ is **bounded** if it is both bounded above and bounded below. 

 - If a [[sequences|sequence]] is bounded above and below, then it is called a **bounded sequence**.

title: $\emptyset$ is bounded above and bounded below
Since for all elements in $\emptyset$, there exists an element where $a\in\emptyset \leq u$ and $a\in\emptyset \geq u$ (vacuously true), $\emptyset$ is bounded.
