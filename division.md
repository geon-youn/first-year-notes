# Division
When $a\neq 0$, $\frac{b}{a}$ is defined to be $b\cdot a^{-1}$. 

If $a$ and $b$ are integers with $a\neq 0$, then $a$ *divides* $b$ if there exists an integer $c$ such that $b=ac$. We say that $a$ is a **factor** or **divisor** of $b$ and that $b$ is a **multiple** of $a$. The notation $a \mid b$ denotes that $a$ divides $b$; $a \nmid b$ denotes that $a$ does not divide $b$.
