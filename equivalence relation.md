# Equivalence relation
A [[binary relation|relation]] on a [[set]] $A$ is called an **equivalence relation** if it is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]], [[symmetric relation|symmetric]], and [[transitive relation|transitive]].

Two elements $a$ and $b$ that are related by an equivalence relation are called equivalent. The notation $a\sim b$ (read as "a tilde b") is often used to denote that $a$ and $b$ are equivalent elements with respect to a particular equivalence relation.
