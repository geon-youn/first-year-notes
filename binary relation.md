# Binary relations
A **binary relation** $R$ from a [[set]] $A$ to a set $B$ is a [[subset]] $R\subseteq A\times B$. 

A [[First Year/function]] is a relation where exactly one element of $B$ is related to each element of $A$. 

A binary relation on a set $A$ is a subset of $A\times A$ or a relation from $A$ to $A$.

There are $2^{|A|^2}$ relations on $A$.
