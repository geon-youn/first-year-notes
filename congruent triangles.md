# Congruent Triangles
Two triangles are [[congruent]] if their three sides and their three corresponding angles are equal. We can alternatively show if the three sides are equal, then the triangles are congruent; or, if two sides of a triangle and the [[angle]] formed by those two sides are equal to two sides of another triangle and the angle formed by those two sides, then the triangles are congruent.
