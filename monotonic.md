# Monotonic
A [[sequences|sequence]]  $\left\{a_n\right\}$ is **increasing** if $a_n<a_{n+1}$ for all $n\geq 1$. It is **decreasing** if $a_n > a_{n+1}$ for all $n\geq 1$. A sequence is called **monotonic** if it is either increasing or decreasing.

## Monotonic sequence theorem
Every [[bound|bounded]], monotonic sequence is [[limit of a sequence|convergent]].
