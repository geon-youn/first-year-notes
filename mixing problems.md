# Mixing problems
If $y(t)$ denotes the amount of substance in the tank at time $t$, then $y'(t)$ is the rate at which the substance is being added *minus* the rate at which it's being removed. This model leads to a first-order [[differential equation]]:

$$\frac{dy}{dt}=\text{(rate in)}-\text{(rate out)}$$
