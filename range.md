# Range
The set **equal to all the outputs** of a [[First Year/function]].

```ad-warning
The range is not the same as the [[codomain]]. The range is a [[subset]] of the codomain, but the codomain is not a subset of the range. 
```

```ad-info
title: In terms of a column space
The range is the [[span]] of its [[column space]].
