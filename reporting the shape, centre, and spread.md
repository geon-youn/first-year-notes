# Reporting the shape, centre, and spread
If the [[shape]] is skewed, the [[centre|median]] and [[spread|IQR]] should be reported.

If the shape is unimodal and symmetric, the mean and standard deviation and possibly the median and IQR should be reported.

If there are unusual observations, point them out and report the mean and standard deviation with and without the values.

```ad-tip
Always pair the **median with the IQR** and the **mean with the standard deviation**.
