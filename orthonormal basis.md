# Orthonormal Basis
Similar to [[orthogonal basis]], but the column vectors are [[orthonormal columns]]. We can obtain an **orthonormal basis** by the [[Gram-Schmidt process]].

```ad-tip
title: Alternative explanation
An **orthonormal basis** is the set consisting of an [[orthogonal matrix]]'s column vectors. 
```

```ad-warning
The Gram-Schmidt process returns an orthogonal basis! Each vector in the set must be divided by its [[norm|length]] to obtain an orthonormal basis.
