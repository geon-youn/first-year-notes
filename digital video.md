# Digital Video
**Digital video** is a sequence of [[digital image]]s and may include [[digital audio]]. A **frame rate** of about 30 frames per second is needed to achieve smooth motion. A **video file** consists of a video track, audio track, and metadata (e.g., captions, language, authors, title, etc.). The video and audio tracks are [[data compression|compressed]] for storage and transmission, and decompressed before playing.
