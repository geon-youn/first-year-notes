# Assigning roles to variables in scatterplots
**Bivariate analysis**: investigating two [[data value|variable]]s.

To make a [[scatterplot]] of two [[types of variables|quantitative]] variables, assign one to the y-axis and the other to the x-axis. 

Each point is placed on a scatterplot at a position that corresponds to the value sof the two variables. Together, these variables are known as **coordinates** and written $(x, y)$. 

One variable, $x$, plays the role of the **explanatory** or **predictor** variable, while the other, $y$, takes on the roles of the **response** variable. 
- $x$: **explanatory, predictor, independent**
- $y$: **response, dependent**
