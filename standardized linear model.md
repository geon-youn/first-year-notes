# Standardized linear model
If we consider finding the [[linear model|least squares line]] for [[standardizing|standardized]] variables $z_x$ and $z_y$, the formula for slope can be simplified as
$$b_1=r\frac{s_y}{s_x}=r\frac{s_{z_y}}{s_{z_x}}=r\frac{1}{1}=r$$

The intercept can be rewritten as
$$b_0=\overline{y}-b_1\overline{x}=\overline{z_y}-b_1\overline{z_x}=0-1(0)=0$$

So if we're working with standardized values, the slope will be equal to $r$ and the intercept is $0$. The formula for the line will be

$$\hat{z_y}=rz_x$$
