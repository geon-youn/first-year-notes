# Copy, Modify, Compare, and Generalize (CMCG)
The CMCG method is a four-step design process to solve a problem $P$. CMCG trades short-term cost for long-term gain.

## Copy
Copy the solution $S'$ to a related problem $P'$. 
## Modify
Modify $S'$ to make it a solution $S$ for $P$.
## Compare
Compare $S$ with $S'$ to find mistakes in $S'$ and to see if $S'$ can be improved.
## Generalize
Generalize $S$ and $S'$ to obtain a solution $S^*$ that solves a family of problems that includes $P$ and $P'$.
