# Scatterplot
**Scatterplot**: plots one [[types of variables|quantitative]] variable against another. An ideal way to picture **associations** between two quantitative variables. Indicate if **two** variables are related. And, if they related, what is the nature of their lreationship.

| Positive linear relationship         | Nonlinear relationship               | No relationship |

**Direction**:
 - a pattern running from the upper left to the lower right is said to be **negative**.
 - a pattern running from the lower left to the upper right is said to be **positive**.
 - otherwise, it is neither. 
 
 **Form**:
  - if there is a straight line relationship, it will appear as a cloud or swarm of points stretched out in a generally consistent, straight form - **linear**.
  - sometimes the relationship curves gently, while still increasing or decreasing steadily; sometimes it curves sharply up then down - **exotic**.
  - otherwise, there is no pattern.
  
  **Strength**: do the points appear tightly clustered in a single stream or do the points seem to be so variable and spread out that we can barely discern any trend or pattern?
  
  **Outlier**: an unusual [[data value|observation]], standing away from the overall pattern of the scatter plot.

  **Association**: is change in the value of one variable associated with change in the value of the other variable?
  - If there is any association between the following variables, is it **positive or negative** and how **strong** is it?
