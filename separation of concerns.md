# Separation of Concerns
The principle that different concerns should be isolated and considered separately. The goal is to reduce a complex problem into a set of simpler problems like in [[divide and conquer]]. It enables parallelization of effort. 

## Separation Methods
- Different concerns are considered at diferent **times**.
- **Software qualities** are considered separately.
- A software system is considered from different **views**.
- **Parts** of a software system are considered separately. 

## Dangers
- Opportunities for global optimization may be lost.
- Some issues cannot be safely isolated (e.g., **security**).
