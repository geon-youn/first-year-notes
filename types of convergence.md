# Types of convergence
A [[series]] $\sum a_n$ is called **absolutely convergent** if the series of absolute values $\sum |a_n|$ is [[divergence test for series|convergent]].

That same series is **conditionally convergent** if it is convergent, but not absolutely convergent. That is, if $\sum a_n$ converges but $\sum |a_n|$ diverges. 

If a series $\sum a_n$ is absolutely convergent, then it is convergent.
