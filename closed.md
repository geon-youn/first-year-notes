# Closed: \[a, b\]
A set $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is **closed** if the [[complement]] of $S$, $\overline{S}=\mathbb{R}-S$ is [[open]]. 

Let $J$ be an index set and let $A_j$ be a family of sets indexed by $J$ with $A_j\subset\mathbb{R}$. If for all $j\in J$, $A_j$ is closed, then $\bigcap_{i=1}A_j$ is closed.
