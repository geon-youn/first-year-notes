# Integrity
**Intrgrity** is the state in which data or resources have not been accidently or maliciously modified or destroyed. Integrity also applies to *metadata* about information and resources like origin, provenance, access history, etc. An integrity violation reduces the **trustworthiness** of the data or resources. There are two approaches to maintain integrity:
1. **Prevention** of unauthorized attempts to modify the data or resources. 
2. **Detection** of integrity violations or unauthorized modifications.

## History
The banking industry has been a major player in the development of mechanisms to protect integrity.
