# Confidence interval for two means
A [[hypothesis testing|hypothesis test]] really says nothing about the size of the difference. All it says is the observed difference is large enough that we can be confident it isn't zero,

When the conditions are met, we can find a **two-sample t-confidence interval**

> $$(\overline{y}_1-\overline{y}_2)\pm t^*_{df} \times SE(\overline{y}_1-\overline{y}_2)$$

Where [[standard error]] is found from [[comparing two means]]. 

A confidence interval tells us *by at least what value* is $\overline{y}_1$ bigger than $\overline{y}_2$ with a certain confidence level.
