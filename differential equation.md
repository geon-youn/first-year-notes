# Differential equation
A **differential equation** is an equation that contains an unknown function and one or more of its derivatives. 

The **order** of a differential equation is the order of the highest derivative that occurs in the equation.

A function $f$ is called a **solution** of a differential equation if the equation is satisfied when $y=f(x)$ and its derivatives are substituted into the equation.

When we are asked to *solve* a differential equation, we are expected to find all possible solutions of the equation.

## Initial-value problem
When applying differential equations, we're usually not interested in finding a family of solutions (the general solution) as we are in finding a solution that satisfies some additional requirement. Usually, we want to satisfy
$$y(t_0)=y_0$$
which is called an **initial-condition**.

Geometrically, we look at a family of solutions and pick one that passes through the initial point: $(t_0, y_0)$.
