# Parametric equation
Suppose that $x$ and $y$ are both given as functions on a third variable $t$, called a **parameter**, by the equations
$$\begin{array}{lr}x=f(t) & y = g(t)\end{array}$$
which are called **parametric equations**. Each value of $t$ determines a point $(x, y)$, which we can plot on a coordinate plane. As $t$ varies, the point $(x, y)=(f(t), g(t))$ varies and traces out a curve called a **parametric curve**. 

You can typically eliminate the parameter by writing one of the variables $x$ or $y$ as $t$ in terms of $x$ or $y$ and substituting into the other variable. But, you lose out on some information like *where* the particle is at any given *time* and the *direction* of motion. 

Sometimes, we restrict the value of $t$. In general, the curve with parametric equations 
$$\begin{array}{ccc}x=f(t) & y=g(t) & a \leq t \leq b\end{array}$$
has **initial point** $(f(a), g(a))$ and **terminal point** $(f(b), g(b))$
