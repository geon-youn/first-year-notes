# Frequency table
**Frequency table**: a frequency table organizes data by recording counts and [[types of variables|category]] names as in the table below:

| Province                  | Corporate Stores |
| ------------------------- | ----------------:|
| Newfoundland and Labrador |               13 |
| Prince Edward Island      |                4 |
| Nova Scotia               |               34 |
| New Brunswick             |               21 |
| Quebec                    |              223 |
| Ontario                   |              155 |

**Relative frequency table**: displays the **proportions** or **percentages** that lie in each category rather than the counts:

| Province    | Corporate Stores (%) |

| Ontario     |                34.44 |
| Nova Scotia |                 7.56 |
| Other       |                 8.44 |
| Total       |               100.00 |

**Frequency distribution**: groups data into categories and records the number of (counts the number of) [[data value|observations]] in each category:
