# Separable equation
A **separable equation** is a first-order [[differential equation]] in which the expression for $dy/dx$ can be factored as a function of $x$ times a function of $y$:
$$\frac{dy}{dx}=g(x)f(y)$$
It's "separable" because the expression on the right side can be "separated" into a function of $x$ and a function of $y$. If $f(y)\neq 0$, then we can write
$$\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{g(x)}{h(y)}\Rightarrow h(y)\,dy=g(x)\,dx$$
where $h(y)=1/f(y)$ and you integrate both sides to solve the differential equation:
$$\int h(y)\,dy=\int g(x)\,dx$$
