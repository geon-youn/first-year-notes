# Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
For all positive [[integers]] $n>1$, there exists a positive integer $s$ and [[prime number]]s $p_1,\dots,p_s$ such that
$$n=p_1\cdot p_2\cdots p_s$$
Moreover, the list of prime numbers with this property is **unique** (up to reordering). Proof can be done by [[Euclid's lemma]].
