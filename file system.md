# File Systems
[[file|Files]] are stored in a [[recursion|recursive]] structure called a **file tree** consisting of
1. **Files**;
2. **Directories** (also called **folders**) that contain files and other directories.

The top-level directory is called the **root directory**. Files and directories are accessed via (full or relative) **pathnames**. Files and directories can be created, deleted, moved, copied, renamed, and modified.
