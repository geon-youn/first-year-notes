# Generalized Eigenvector
When an [[eigenspace]] has a [[dimension]] less than the [[multiplicity]] of the given [[eigenvalue]], you can find another eigenvector, called a **generalized eigenvector**, where you make the [[solving eigenvalues and eigenvectors|characteristic polynomial]] equal to one of the existing [[eigenvector]]s instead of the zero vector. Then, the generalized eigenvector will equal the zero vector when the characteristic polynomial is applied to it $k$ times, where $k$ is the multiplicity of the eigenvalue.
