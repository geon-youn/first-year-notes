# Contingency table
**Contingency table**: shows how the values of one [[data value|variable]] is **contingent** on the value of another variable (2 variables). 

E.g., the use of social networks in different countries:

|       | Britain | Egypt | Germany | Russia | United States | Total |
| ----- | ------- | ----- | ------- | ------ | ------------- | ----- |
| No    | 336     | 70    | 460     | 90     | 293           | 1249  |
| Yes   | 529     | 300   | 340     | 500    | 506           | 2175  |
| N/A   | 153     | 630   | 200     | 420    | 212           | 1615  |
| Total | 1018    | 1000  | 1000    | 1010   | 1011          | 5039  |

**Marginal distribution**: the marginal distribution of a variable in a contingency table is the total count that occurs without reference to the value of the other variables (the total row/column). 

Each **cell** of a contingency table gives the count for a combination of values of both variables. 

We may display the data as a percentage - as a **row percent**, **column percent**, or a **total percent** which show percentages with respect to the row count, column count, or total count, respectively. 

**Conditional distributions**: restrict variables in a distribution to show the distribution for just those cases that satisfy a specified condition (e.g., social networking use given the country of focus is Egypt). 

**Segmented bar chart**: divides a bar proportionally into segments corresponding to the percentage in each group.
