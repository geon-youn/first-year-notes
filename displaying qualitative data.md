# Displaying [[types of variables|quantitative]] data
**Histograms**: a histogram plots the **bin** counts as the height of bars and describes the overall [[shape]] of data. 
- Decide how wide to make the bins
    - if there are $n$ data points, use $\log_2 n$ for the number of bins
- Determine the count for each bin
- Decide where to place values that land on the endpoints of a bin. For example, does a value of $5 go into the $0 to $5 bin or the $5 to $10 bin? The standard rule is to place such values in the *higher bin*.

**Stem-and-leaf**: split data according to a **stem** (all digits but the last) and **leaf** (last digit). For example to display the data 21, 22, 24, 33, 33, 36, 38, 41 in a stem-and-leaf display:

| Stem | Leaf |
| ---- | ---- |
| 2    | 124  |
| 3    | 3368 |
| 4    | 1    |

A stem-and-leaf forms a histogram that's rotated clockwise. 

```ad-warning
Before making a histogram or a stem-and-leaf display, the quantitative data condition must be satisfied.

**Quantitative data condition**: the data values are of quantitative variables whose units are known. 
```

When describing a distribution, we pay attention to its
- [[shape]]
- [[centre]]
- [[spread]]
