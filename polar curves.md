# Polar curves
The **graph of a polar equation** $r=f(\theta)$, or more generally $F(r,\theta)=0$, consists of all points $P$ that have at least one [[polar coordinate system|polar coordinate]] representation $(r,\theta)$ whose coordinates satisfy the equation.

> The equation $r=a$ represents a circle with center $O$ and radius $|a|$

> The equation $\theta=b$ represents a straight line that passes through $O$ and makes an angle of $b$ radians with the polar axis.
