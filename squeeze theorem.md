# Squeeze theorem
Compared to [[properties of convergent sequences|Squeeze Theorem]] defined there, we look at it in terms of [[First Year/function]]s and [[limit]]s: 

If $f(x)\leq g(x)\leq h(x)$ when $x$ is near $a$ (except possibly at $a$) and

$$\lim_{x \rightarrow a}f(x)=\lim_{x \rightarrow a}h(x)=L$$

then

$$\lim_{x \rightarrow a}g(x)=L$$
