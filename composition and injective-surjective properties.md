# Function Composition and Injective/Surjective Properties

Let $f:X \mapsto Y$ and $g:Y \mapsto Z$ be [[First Year/function]].
1. If $f:X \mapsto Y$ and $g:Y \mapsto Z$ are both [[injective]], then $g \circ f : X \mapsto Z$ is **injective**.[^1]
2. If $f:X \mapsto Y$ and $g:Y \mapsto Z$ are both [[surjective]], then $g \circ f : X \mapsto Z$ is **surjective**.[^2]
3. If $f:X \mapsto Y$ and $g:Y \mapsto Z$ are both [[bijective]], then $g \circ f : X \mapsto Z$ is **bijective**.
4. If $g \circ f : X \mapsto Z$ is **injective**, then $f:X \mapsto Y$ is **injective**.[^3] $g$ does not need to be injective.[^4]
5. If $g \circ f : X \mapsto Z$ is **surjective**, then $g:Y \mapsto Z$ is **surjective**. $f$ does not need to be surjective.[^5]
