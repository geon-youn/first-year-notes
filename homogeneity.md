# Homogeneity of Systems
A system $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$ is called **homogeneous** if $\vec{b}=\vec{0}$. Otherwise, it is called **inhomogeneous**.

```ad-question
title: Is every **inhomogeneous** system [[existence and uniqueness theorem|consistent]]?
No! It can be [[existence and uniqueness theorem#^8efd91|inconsistent]].
```

```ad-question
title: Is every **homogeneous** system [[existence and uniqueness theorem|consistent]]?
Yes! It always has the zero vector $\vec{0}$ as a solution.
