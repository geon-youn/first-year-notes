# Orthogonal trajectories
An **orthogonal trajectory** of a family of curves is a curve that intersects each curve of the family orthogonally (at right angles). 

To solve for the trajectories, given a function $y=kf(x)$, differentiate to get $dy/dx=kf'(x)$, remove the $k$ value by substitution ($k=y/f(x)$) $dy/dx = yf'(x)/f(x)$ take the negative reciprocal $dy/dx=-f(x)/yf'(x)$ and solve this new [[differential equation]].
