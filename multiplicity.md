# Multiplicity
The number of times a root appears in an equation. 

```ad-example
The root $x=1,2$ has multiplicity 1:
$$(x-1)(x-2)=0$$
The root $x=1$ has multiplicity 2 and $x=2$ has multiplicity 1:
$$(x-1)^2(x-2)=0$$
The root $x=1$ has multiplicity 2 and $x=2$ has multiplicity 3:
$$(x-1)^2(x-2)^3=0$$
