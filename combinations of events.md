# Combinations of events
If $E_1, E_2,\dots$ is a sequence of pairwise [[probability|disjoint]] events in a [[Pierre-Simon Laplace's classical theory of probability|sample space]] $S$, then

$$p\left(\bigcup_i E_i\right)=\sum_i p(E_i)$$

It's similar to the [[general probability of complements and unions]], but with [[arbitrary union]]s. 

```ad-note
Since the events are **disjoint**, $p(E_i\cap E_j)=0$ for any $E_i, E_j\in S$.
