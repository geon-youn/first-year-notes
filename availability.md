# Availability
The state in which information or resources can be used as needed. Availability is an important aspect of **reliability**; a reliable [[server]] should have high availability. 

**Denial of service attacks** are attempts to block availability; for example, they can send so many requests that real requests are not sent through. They are difficult to detect because they can look like legitimate, but possibly atypical, attempts to access information and resources.
