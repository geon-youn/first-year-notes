# Types of variables
**Categorical/qualitative**: names categories, indicates whether or not a [[data value|case]] falls into a certain category.

**Quantitative**: measures numerical values with/without units. Tells us about the *quantity* of something.

**Identifiers**: identity cases in databases. An identifier is *unique*.
 - categorical variable
 - unitless
 - helps to combine different datasets and makes relational databases possible
 - *are not to be analyzed*
 
 **Nominal**: categorical variables used only to name categories (e.g. school attended).
 
 **Ordinal**: if a variable can be ordered.
 
 **Time series**: data that are gathered at regular intervals over time.
 
 **Cross-sectional data**: when data for several variables are measured at the same point in time.
