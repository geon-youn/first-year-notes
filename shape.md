# Shape
We describe the **shape** of a distribution in terms of its **modes**, its **symmetry**, and whether it has any **gaps** or **outlying** values. 

| Negatively skewed or skewed left     | Symmetric distribution               | Positively skewed or skewed right    |

**Modes**: peaks or humps seen in a histogram.

A distribution whose [[displaying qualitative data|histogram]] has one main peak is called **unimodal**, two peaks - **bimodal**, three or more peaks - **multimodal**. 

Bimodal:

**Uniform**: a distribution whose histogram doesn't appear to have any clear mode and in which all bars are approximately the same height:

**Symmetric**: a distribution where the halves on either side of the centre look, at least approximately, like mirror images:

**Tails**: the thinner ends of a distribution. 

**Skewed**: where one of the tail stretches out farther than the other. The distribution is *skewed* to the side of the longer tail:

**Outliers**: values that stand off away from the body of the distribution. Outliers
- can affect every statistical method
- can be the most informative part of your data
- may be an error in the data
- should be discussed in any conclusions drawn avbout the data
