# [[IP]] Addresses
**IP addresses** are assigned according to a scheme that is uniform accross the [[internet|Internet]]. There are two Internet naming systems:
1. The primary system is the **internet address system** which uses binary **IP addresses**.
2. The second system is the **domain name system (DNS)** which uses natural language **DNS names**. 

IP addresses are 32-bit integers. They are composed of four 8-bit octets and are represented as four integers, usually in base 2 or base 10, separated by dots. 

```ad-example
base 2: 11000111.00010001.00101000.11010010
base 10: 199.17.40.210
```

Each [[physical network|network interface]] on the Internet is normally assigned a **unique** IP address.
