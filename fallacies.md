# Fallacies
Resembles [[rules of inference|rules of inference]], but are based on [[contingency|contingencies]] rather than [[tautology|tautologies]].

## Fallacy of Affirming the Conclusion
$$\begin{array}{ll}
& p\rightarrow q\\
& q\\
\hline
\therefore & p
\end{array}\Leftrightarrow\begin{array}{ll}
& p\rightarrow q\\
& q\\
\hline
\therefore & \neg p
\end{array}$$

is not a tautology since it is false when $p$ is false and $q$ is true. 

## Fallacy of Denying the Hypothesis
$$\begin{array}{ll}
& p\rightarrow q\\
& \neg p\\
\hline
\therefore & \neg q
\end{array}\Leftrightarrow\begin{array}{ll}
& p\rightarrow q\\
& \neg p\\
\hline
\therefore & q
\end{array}$$
is not a tautology since it is false when $p$ is false and $q$ is true.
