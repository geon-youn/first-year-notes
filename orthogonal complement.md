# Orthogonal Complement

Let $A$ be an $m \times n$ matrix. The orthogonal complement of the [[row space]] of $A$ is the [[null space]] of $A$, and the orthogonal complement of the [[column space]] of $A$ is the [[null space]] of $A^{T}$:
$$(\operatorname{Row}A)^\perp=\operatorname{Nul}A$$
and
$$(\operatorname{Col}A)^\perp=\operatorname{Nul}A^{T}$$

title: Alternative explanation
The **orthogonal complemnent** is equivalent to the [[subspace]] that is [[orthogonal]] to another subspace. 
```

If $W$ is a subspace of a [[vector space]] $V$ and the [[dimension]] of $V$ is finite, then $W=(W^\perp)^\perp$. If $V$ is infinite dimensional, then $W\subseteq (W^\perp)^\perp$.
