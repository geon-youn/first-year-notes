# American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII)
ASCII is a character scheme based on the English alphabet. It consists of 128 characters (94 printable, the space, and 33 nonprintable) represented by 7- or 8-bits. Nonprintable characters like the newline character are denoted by **escape characters** (e.g. `\n`). ASCII is not used as often as [[Unicode]] because of its lack of diversity and support for different languages. *sjadksja*
