# Variations in the model and R squared
All [[linear model|regression model]]s fall somewhere between the two extremes of zero correlation or perfect correlation of $r=\pm1$. 

We consider the square of the [[understanding correlation|correlation coefficient]] $r$ to be $r^2$, which is a value between $0$ and $1$. 

$r^2$ gives the fraction of the data's ([[assigning roles to variables in scatterplots|response]] variable's) variation accounted for by the model.

$1-r^2$ is the fraction of the original variation left in the residuals. 

$r^2$ by tradition is written $R^2$ and called "**R squared**"
