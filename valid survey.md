# Valid survey
**Valid survey**: a [[sampling|survey]] that can yield the information you need about the population in which you are interested. 

To ensure a valid survey, you need to ask four questions:
- what do I want to know?
- who are the right respondents?
- what are the right questions?
- what will be done with the results?

Be clear about what you want to learn, phrasing questions and answers and use the right [[simple random sample (SRS)|sampling frame]].

**Nonresponse bias**: when individuals don't respond to questions.

**Voluntary response bias**: in volunteer surveys, individuals with the strongest feelings on either side of an issue are more likely to respond; those who don't care may not bother.

**Measurement errors**: when a question does not take into account all possible answers.

```ad-warning
Don't confuse **inaccuracy** with **bias**:
