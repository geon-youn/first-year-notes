# Computational Thinking
**Computational thinking** is thinking inspired, supported, or enabled by computing. It's also using the **right computational tools** in the right way for the problem at hand; and understanding the **limits and pitfalls** of computational tools. 

As a consequence of [[computing]], computational thinking includes [[mathematical thinking]], [[engineering thinking]], [[scientific thinking]], and [[artistic thinking]].

## Commandments
Computational thinking is... 
1. Using the right computational tools in the right way for the problem at hand.
2. Understanding the limits and pitfalls of computational tools.
3. Solving problems by [[recursion]].
4. Proving properties by [[induction]].
5. Defining data using [[algebraic data type|algebraic types]].
6. Defining functions over algebraic types using recursion and pattern matching.
7. Utilizing virtual systems.
8. Employing models with several layers of [[abstraction]].
9. Identifying [[threat]]s to [[information security]] and devising the means to protect against them.
10. Using encryption of [[conventional encryption|various]] [[public key encryption|kinds]] to protect information security.
11. Using [[little language]] to solve families of problems.
12. Using a [[software development process|rational development process]] to produce quality software.
