# Internet Structure
The Internet is a two-layered system:
1. Heterogeneous collection of underlying [[physical network]]s;
2. Homogeneous **virtual network** implemented using TCP/IP protocol software on top of the physical networks.

Corresponding to the two layers of the Internet are two layers of addresses:
- [[physical address]]es
- [[IP address]]es
