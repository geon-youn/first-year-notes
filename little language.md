# Little Languages
What do we do if we solve a problem, but later the problem requirements change? Our solution becomes a solution for thje wrong problem and we may need to star the problem solving process over. 

A better approach is to create a [[abstraction|little language]] that can be used to solve a **family of related problems**. The components of the language are designed to work together to solve a wide range of problems. The family includes the problems at hand. If the problem requirements change, the language can be used to construct a solution to the new problem. This approach is called the **little languages method** (also called the **method of domain-specific languages**).
