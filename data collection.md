# Data collection
**Primary data**: collected by the researcher/analyst.

**Secondary data**: collected by another party, like Statistics Canada obtained by the researcher/analyst. 

**When** and **where** data was collected is important. **How** data is collected can make the difference between insight and nonsense (e.g. data collected through internet polls vs. polling agencies).
