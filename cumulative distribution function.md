# Cumulative distribution function
## Discrete
We can also define [[random variable|discrete random variable]] by their **cumulative distribution function (CDF)** instead of [[discrete probability distribution|probability mass function]]. 

For any value $x$ of the random variable $X$, the CDF is defined as $P(X\leq x)$. 

```ad-example
Suppose you throw a fair die and the random variable $X$ is the number showing. 

- For $x=2$, the CDF $P(X\leq 2)=2/6$
- For $x=4$, the CDF $P(X\leq 4)=4/6$
- For $x=6$, the CDF $P(X\leq 6)=6/6$
```

## Continuous
For a continuous random variable $X$, its CDF, denoted $F(x)$ is defined as
$$F(x)=P(X\leq x)$$

```ad-note
$F(x)$ is for the CDF, $f(x)$ is for the PDF
